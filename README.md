# German Text Complexity Annotations by Students

## Dataset

This repository contains data collected from 193 German students who annotated German sentences for text complexity. The dataset is part of a research project aimed at analyzing and predicting text difficulty based on person-related and linguistic features. The dataset consists of 3954 German sentences annotated by students using a 5-point Likert scale.

## Publication

We updated the dataset and are currently working on updating our publication. Our latest contribution can be found [here](https://educationaldatamining.org/edm2024/proceedings/2024.EDM-posters.77/2024.EDM-posters.77.pdf). The publication still refers to the dataset in the folder `/old_version/annotations.csv`, but the updated dataset is already available in the file `annotations_new.csv`.
